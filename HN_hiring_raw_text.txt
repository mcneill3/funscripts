Julia Computing Inc [http://juliacomputing.com] | Cambridge, MA
Julia Computing Inc. is looking for an LLVM engineer to work on LLVM, LLDB and Clang to improve integration with the Julia programming language.

Immediate high-priority projects
  - LLVM’s JIT debugging and debug info

  - Julia’s Clang-based C++ FFI – Cxx.jl
  - Julia’s (experimental) LLDB-based debugger
On-going responsibilities and longer-term projects
  - Working with Julia code gen experts to improve Julia’s generation of LLVM IR
  - Fixing LLVM bugs encountered by Julia (we use LLVM hard, so this happens a fair bit)
  - Tuning LLVM optimizations for Julia’s usage patterns (which differ somewhat from C/C++)
  - Porting Julia to new architectures by adding/enhancing LLVM backends.
  architecture of interest include ARM, Xeon Phi (Knight’s Landing), GPUs
  - Improving any relevant LLVM tooling
Both full-time employment and short-term consulting opportunities are available. This advertisement is for our Boston (Cambridge), MA, USA office and being local is ideal, but REMOTE engineers will also be considered. Applicants should possess demonstrable experience working in the LLVM ecosystem.
If this position interests you, or you have any questions, please contact us at jobs@juliacomputing.com.
About Julia Computing
Julia Computing was founded by the creators of Julia in response to industry demand for professional support, consulting and training.

Soundslice - Web designer - Chicago, IL. ONSITE.
Soundslice (https://www.soundslice.com/) is "living sheet music." We make web-based, responsive music-notation technology that you can listen to and interact with. The goal is to be the best way to learn any piece of music.
See https://www.soundslice.com/demo for an example. It's one of the coolest HTML5 web apps in the world that's an actual business and not a project. When I originally posted it to HN, it stayed at the top of the homepage for the better part of a day and was universally praised: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4790636
Soundslice is a small (two-person) business -- you'd be the third. It's proudly bootstrapped and makes money.
We're looking for a web designer. Somebody who's good at the whole design process -- understanding problems, creating mockups, implementing in HTML/CSS.
WHY WORK HERE:
* You'd work on an amazing product that helps people learn music.
* Design is front-and-center of our product. Much of its value is pure design/UX.
* Excellent work/life balance.
* You'd work with me (one of the people who created Django, plus some other stuff; see holovaty.com). I'm an experienced developer and can teach you a lot, if you're open to it.

Planet Labs has a large number of positions open. We're a collection of electrical, mechanical, aerospace, software, science, etc. folks looking to image the whole planet on a daily basis with a large number of small satellites. It's a terrific bunch of folks doing what we call "agile aerospace".
I've personally been with the company for over a year, working on "Mission Control", an internal web app for managing the satellites and make life easier on our "Spaceship Captains" -- the operators who manage them. This is definitely one of the most interesting and fun roles I've had in my career (and I've had a few).
Python (Flask, Django) and Javascript (React, Backbone) are used heavily in the web projects. We of course have systems programming to do for the onboard software. Plenty of other interesting work from the satellite design and various subsystems, manufacturing, georectification of images, image corrections, dev ops, site reliability engineers, and heaps of possibilities with a supremely interesting dataset that we're growing.

NoRedInk in San Francisco (or remote, up to 6h time zone difference from Pacific)
Full stack rails engineers wanted to make sure that grammer is taught good. Every one's revolutioneyesing educaton but while some student's cant even right the write words.
Then there was NoRedInk.
NoRedInk helps students quickly improve their grammar and writing skills. We've got a small, technically excellent engineering team. We extensively use React.js and Flux in production, and have begun using the compile-to-JS language Elm alongside them. I work here because I get to learn about my practice (as well as my failing grammar skills) every day.
I work here because I care about education. I work here because existing online tools for teaching grammar and writing are pathetic. Join us as engineer #8, and improve how grammar is taught.

We're a high-standards group with a lot of pride in our products, code, and people. We understand consumer scale and data (Reddit co-founder & engineers) and aspire to build products that customers love. We've had success due to this, consistently getting 4-5 star reviews on app/play stores and net promoter scores at or above the best in the tech industry.
We're friends and work hard to enable folks to do their best work. Processes are light and trust is high. At 31 engineers we're not so big where you can't know everyone well and have an impact, but not so small where it's chaos and you don't have anyone to learn from. We value learning and growth (and not having bored people) and invest regular time in doing so. For example, every other Friday is open time for you to do stuff that helps you be a better engineer.
We're looking for folks that love all of the above and will help us keep our standards high. You can go to www.hipmunk.com/jobs if you're interested!

Pageload recenly aquired venture captial to accelerate the global rollout. We strongly believe that everyone who wants to work with us does it because it's an area they like to spend time in, be it jpeg headers or shaving cpu cycles off css minifacation. We don't have requirements as to when or from where you work -- that's most often best decided by yourself.
Our platform is [at the moment] built with nodejs. We are (currently) looking for one position:

Akkuma 5 days ago

I wanted to let others know I went through the first and second part of the interview for Code Wrangler and it certainly was one of the more unique ones.
The first part was a Skype text chat that lasted for over an hour. It was not like anything I ever had before. For starters, there is no conversing through voice. I talked pretty much only about why I chose Elixir for a project and explaining a lot about Elixir itself. The interview itself seemed like a test to see how well I knew what I was talking about, could convey information to someone without experience in the tech, and remain calm without getting frustrated about someone questioning everything, etc.
The second part of the interview was trial by fire of taking a WordPress plugin, adding a new feature, and ultimately improving it. If you don't work in PHP or have any experience in WordPress this is a lot more work than you'd expect if you are like me and go to serious lengths to improve it all around. I myself have neither real experience in PHP or WordPress. I was given a week to accomplish this, but strangely enough my contact never followed up with me after I told him I had completed it via Skype until I sent him an email several days later. I did get some feedback, but at this point I had decided on taking a job offer from someone else rather than chance not getting hired after their Trial, if it were to be offered to me, which it sounded like based on the feedback I would.
For the most part, the process left a favorable impression, so don't be scared to give it a shot. I think the roughest part was my contact was not US based, so you can't get responses as quickly.

If we can find folks who do both, that's great. That's a hard unicorn to find. :)
We're really hiring both data scientists and data engineers. In my case I do a bit of both, but lean more towards scaling large systems. We also have folks who fall squarely into either the scientist or engineer camps.
Titles can never capture the spectrum of what a person can or wants to do. Scaling large data processing and storage systems, understanding user behavior, deploying everything from simple ranking to advanced machine learning, integrating clever algorithms seamlessly with front end web development to create fluid experiences for our users... All of this is important to us.

You mentioned to Akumma that "the pre-test before the trial project depends on the position. For Data Wranglers it is very different from the one you had."

No personal experience, but I can't imagine thinking less of someone for taking work with a candidate, even if I didn't personally like the candidate – it'd at least make you stand out a little more. Plus, if there were a hiring manager who would hold it against you that you worked for Hillary Clinton or Mitt Romney or John McCain or whomever, that's probably a manager who's unbearable in other ways too.
One potential (and, again, totally made-up) caveat: Working for a well-known politician like Hillary Clinton is probably very different from working with a joke candidate or the "Rent is too damn high" guy.

Amazon | AmazonUI (AUI) | Seattle; San Francisco | Onsite | Full-Time
AUI is the Front-end platform being adopted on Amazon.com. We are modernizing the company's front end code base, while diving deep on latency, performance, API design, user experience, and cross browser/device compatibility. Basically, we need people who can build libraries, not just use them.
Our team is incredibly customer-centric. For any given situation, we have to make the right choice on behalf of the folks using our platform -- and we have to do it at scale. That may sound cliche, but within the next hour AUI will be used to generate tens of millions of page views. And that's just in the US. Worldwide, we're used on about 90% of requests across all device categories.
It's a lot of responsibility, but also a lot of opportunity. For example, we can run experiments that change almost every page on Amazon.com. We can also impact the page load time for the entire site. Have you ever tried to figure out why your site is 6ms slower? We have.
We use these tools (but don't expect you to know all of them): HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Java, Perl, Git
And to give you an idea of who you will be working with, the folks responsible for this articles are on our team: http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-...
If you're interested, drop us an email. Heck, you can even drop us an email if you're in Seattle or San Francisco and you just want to have coffee:
  function getEmailAddr( company ) {
      company = company.replace(/\.com$/i, "").toLowerCase();
      return String.fromCharCode(97, 117, 105, 45, 104, 110) + "@" + company + ".com";
  }

FindTheBest.com | Santa Barbara, CA
What are we up to: We are building the deepest, broadest, baddest knowledge graph on the planet. We have billions of entities, hundreds of billions of facts, an amazing presentation layer, and a growing distribution network of top tier publishers. Everyone needs knowledge (we have well over 100M citations a month), and we’re here to satisfy that need.
What’s next: we’ve built an amazing product architecture that leverages our expansive knowledge graph. The next step is to become a dominant force in the growing knowledge industry. I'd love to talk to anyone working or interested in this exciting space. Unsolicited outreach is strongly encouraged!
About the team: The challenge of scaling human organizations is not unlike the task of scaling a technology stack. Just as large monolithic software applications tend to become ineffective and fail, a highly scalable engineering organization can't be dependent on hierarchy. Developers, designers, and data analysts can form small, cross-functional, mission-oriented teams that are able to operate decoupled of one another (Bezo's 2PT). Besides yielding more effective results, this distributed systems approach to human organizations promotes a happier, more harmonious engineering culture.

Our platform is currently live in NYC and SF, where we work with 160 awesome startups. We’ve had to turn away one of every two companies that have tried to join the network.
As we scale, we’ll focus on building tools for candidates to organize, search, and discover new job opportunities.

Speaking from experience as one of the two current software engineers at Underdog.io. This is a great team to work with, we all strongly believe in the product and being so small (only 4 employees right now) we all get a lot of say in the direction of the company and the products we are building.
From a more engineer stand point, as a team we believe in the value of quality code, transparency, knowledge sharing and contributing back to the open source community in any ways that we can. These are values that we will continue to uphold even as our team grows.
We are running on an service oriented architecture with an internal API (Python/Flask) that is utilized by two other applications, our main website (Python/Flask) and an internal application (Node.js/express).
If you have any questions please feel free to ask. :)

Clever (YC S12) - Software Engineer - San Francisco - Onsite
Right now the market for educational software is a mess. It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and it’s even harder for them to scale. School districts spend tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing. Teachers know there’s great software out there, but relatively simple challenges like getting 30 students logged in at once make using it impossible.
At Clever, we’re working to change all that. We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze. We’ve grown fast: after three years, we’re moving data for a quarter of all K-12 students in America (16M kids), and 36,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps. Our goals are much bigger than that, though. We want to be two things:
-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and
-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.
We’re a team of 60 (25 engineers) based in downtown SF. We’re looking for full-stack engineers who like:
-Go, Coffeescript and Python (or are willing to learn)
-big responsibilities (there are 700,000 students on the platform per engineer here)
-hard technical problems (managing a huge, constantly updating data pipeline)
-tech talks on everything ranging from the history of hip-hop to neuroscience to exoplanets

A little bit about us:
- We write custom software of all shapes and sizes for clients all over the US.

- We aren't limited to any specific set of technologies, which is a great
  opportunity to learn. In the past two years, I've worked with Python, iOS,
  Angular.js, CoffeeScript, QT, Node, Ruby, Rails, and more.

- We practice a sustainable pace. Late nights and > 40 hour weeks are
  rare by design. For example. last year I worked an average of 40.408 hours per
  week.

  sharing, retirement + match, weekly catered lunches, and a top-floor office
  with snacks, guitars, and your choice of standing or sitting desks.

  the Beer Advocate top 15. HopCat is a “World Class” bar on BA.
  Just look here: http://beeradvocate.com/beerfly/city/43

  30% lower than the rent of my 1 bedroom apartment in Mountain View.
A little bit about you:
- You love making software, and you have experience with a variety of technologies.

- You learn new stuff quickly. You’ve used a lot of technologies, but you’re not
  afraid to use more.

Bytemark (York, UK) is looking for an experienced web developer. We're seeking someone who is able to get things done from scratch, who can tell us about something they made the web and say "I made that!".
We need an engineer who is comfortable working at both the front- and back-end of a modern web application. You should be able to pick apart HTML, Javascript, the DOM, HTTP, SQL and a back-end framework or two. We use Ruby & Go, but particular languages aren't as important as a proven track record, and a desire to get projects delivered.
At Bytemark we build our own cloud hosting infrastructure, so the more you know about IP networking and operating systems, the better. We're also steeped in Free Software, its history and licenses, so any expertise there would put you in good company.
We have processes that work for our small team: we test automatically, but usually think we could do more. We use Git or Mercurial for revision control, Redmine to keep track of our bugs, and Jenkins for CI. We meet fortnightly rather than daily. We trust you to pick the right project from our development plan; we don't over-manage. In short, we have an evolving methodology and a wealth of experience — this means we can quickly and efficiently deliver new features for our customers. Join, and help us do more! We have our own data centre and cloud hosting platform (https://www.bigv.io/), and are looking for a web developer to join our engineering team.
Location: York, Manchester, remote considered for more experienced engineers.
Salary: £32500 to £48000
We are an equal opportunities employer - we don't even want to know your name or see your CV until the third round of interviews.
Therefore please apply through our anonymous recruitment process where you won't need to give your name to get an interview: https://careers.bytemark.co.uk/positions/4

We're much more likely to have someone turn compile 20K lines of C++ code with optimizations for the first time and have them tell us there's a bug in the compiler; but in reality their program has some undefined behavior that happens to behave differently with optimizations on -- and it's our job to find it!

If you thrive on troubleshooting software problems and designing creative solutions, enjoy learning about new technology, and want to jump in and save customers in desperate need of a hero, this is the job for you!
Job Requirements:
* Learn and understand the inner workings of complex software systems
* Quickly diagnose technical problems with limited information
* Succinctly explain complex technical concepts to experts from other technical domains

Many of you will be familiar with NCC Group's legacy US names - Matasano Security, iSEC Partners, and Intrepidus Group. We're now all officially integrated under the NCC Group name and one happy family.
The bottom line: if you love security and research, NCC Group just may be a perfect fit for you.
What do we do exactly? Penetration testing, security analysis, and cutting-edge research into current technologies and attacks (breaking things). You spend most of your day thinking about security systems and how they can break. You get to be creative and have a lot of freedom to be clever while learning new technologies at a very fast pace. Engagements are usually 2-4 weeks long and in a year you will be exposed to 15-20 products and technology stacks. Your work will typically initiate person-months of security improvements in products millions of people use. You will have access to senior engineers/architects and your findings/ideas will be heard by senior decision makers. You will have enormous impact in making the software people use safer. All of our consultants are also security researchers, with dedicated research time. Not too shabby!

Heavy on one or the other is okay but some exposure to both is necessary: we continuously hack on our in-house C# hedging platform, and we don't do it with corporate IT specs and requirements thrown over the wall, so you need to be able to understand how our hedging strategies work.

Distilled (www.distilled.net) is hiring in London, New York City (NYC) and Seattle WA - all permanent, full-time roles.
We have a whole host of open positions: https://www.distilled.net/jobs/
In particular, we would very much like to talk to digital marketing / SEO consultants in any of our cities.
We recently had an all-hands email thread where the whole team discussed what brought them to Distilled, and why they are still here. It got many great replies (including a number talking about how people's friends had typically had 2-3 jobs in the time they'd been with us), but this one stood out:
"A combination of an informal environment, freedom, and high expectations - I wanted a place where I could be myself and grow doing/learning things that I was passionate about, while having lots of smart people around me to collaborate with in doing so. I came from a huge, strictly regimented and siloed company, and was fed up with being told "that's a great idea, but it's not your job", and Distilled seemed to be the polar opposite."

Insikt (pronounced “in-seekt”) is a white label loan origination and investing platform that enables any brand to lend to its customers and any accredited investor to invest in consumer loan portfolios.
Insikt was born out of our realization that banks will not be the lenders of tomorrow – brands will. Traditional banks, saddled with new rules and regulation, are no longer in the business of taking risk and making loans and cannot be relied on to deliver credit access and opportunity to the masses. Instead, tomorrow’s lenders will be media companies, retailers and prominent brands that have deep relationships with their customers and want to step in to help their customers get a fair loan. But, to do it right, they need scoring, servicing, technology and capital — all of which are expensive and difficult to build. So, why build it if you don’t have to? This is the future of lending. Any brand or company can be a lender. We’ve launched “Lending as a Service” (LaaS) to power this transformation.
We are bringing together the best and brightest to solve real problems in the financial industry. We are looking for diverse talent across many different domains including designers, front end and back end development, product management, analytics and data science, credit, operations, and capital markets.We want passionate, fun-loving people who can contribute positively to our company and our culture. Let us know if this sounds like you.

IdealSpot Inc, Austin, TX, ONSITE, INTERNS possible
IdealSpot is looking for a backend engineer!
IdealSpot brings the power of machine learning to retail site selection. Basically, we work with the massive amount of location-based data sources out there to help businesses find the best place to open a new location.
We're a young startup (less than a year old), but now that we have seed funding, we're looking to scale up our business. We'd like to handle a huge number of data sources, with a huge number of models processing them, providing value to a huge number of businesses. Since we're so early in our development, there's a lot of room to help us work out the architecture, and make a big impact in how our business works.
Most importantly, we are looking for general software engineering skills. You should be able to dive into any problem and understand the interactions between all the different parts of it. You should be able to write clean, maintainable, modular code. That said, we are looking for somebody who can:
* Code in Python (preferably including NumPy/SciPy/Pandas/Scikit-learn)
* Work with "messy" data--scraping websites, working with CSV/JSON/REST APIs, automating cleanup tasks, etc.
* Interact with databases (we use Postgres/PostGIS/Mongo, and more are on the horizon)
* Do some basic sysadmin-type work, including working with Linux, EC2, Docker
If you don't know all of these, (or even if you do!), show us that you can learn quickly. Or even show us what we can use that's better!
Send us an email at work@idealspot.com if you're interested. Feel free to include any past work you can show us, such as a GitHub profile.

CLVmetrics |Lead Full Stack Engineer - First Employee | Philadelphia, PA w/ NYC early 2016 | Onsite or Remote
CLVmetrics (http://www.clvmetrics.com) is a technology company with a simple but important belief: companies should treat their customers differently based on each customer’s lifetime value (CLV) to the business. Our goal is to enable firms to do so by providing access to the cutting-edge statistical models of co-founder Wharton Professor Peter Fader that forecast customer behavior far into the future. To accomplish this goal and allow companies to implement customer-centric marketing strategies, our world-class team of statisticians, marketers, and data scientists is building an enterprise-grade cloud-based analytics suite to commercialize our own award-winning research on consumer behavior, marketing theory, and statistics.
Our founding team has the technical expertise for the back-end (C++ and R), and we are looking to add an expert full stack developer to the team to help us design, code, and ultimately manage the system architecture as we deploy our product. Currently, our stack runs on AWS with Python (Flask) and AngularJS on the front end. Experience with SQL/NoSQL technologies a huge plus.
The key issues that we will face are:
-Infrastructure security: We’re touching some of a corporation's most sensitive data
-System robustness: This will be mission-critical software for a company as they will base numerous marketing decisions on the information
-Scalability: We will be working with massive data sets (millions of customers and hundreds of millions of transactions) and computationally intensive models

Web developer: full-stack, frontend, or backend. Most of us work at all levels of the web stack, but if your strength lies in just frontend or backend work, that's okay too.
We're a small team (15 people) using PHP, Zend Framework, MySQL, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, RabbitMQ, and memcached. We have a customer-facing site, a JSON API, logistics software, and an internal admin site, all of which we build and maintain internally.
Hitmeister.de is one of the largest online shopping portals in Germany, with over 2 million customers to date. We have a warehouse from which we sell items directly, but we also have a marketplace with over 2,000 sellers running their own shops. We're seeing solid growth and we're looking for more programming talent to grow and improve the site.
Speaking German is helpful, but by no means required. I'm from the US and we have 3 other non-German developers. If you aren't an EU citizen, we are glad to help with visa issues. In particular, if you have a CS degree or at least 5 years of experience you probably qualify for an EU Blue Card, and we have lots of experience with those.

If you're looking for a little puzzle to do, write a code snippet (in any language) that converts the word "hiring" into decimal Unicode points and then concatenates their decimal representations back into a string.

Regarding your puzzle, the mention of unicode is strange considering the string "hiring" can be handled with ordinals < 255 in any language (ie: no special handling for unicode required). Some languages make unicode ordinals easy, others not so much. Perhaps encoded("hiring☺")@smartgift.it? ;)

We are hiring front-end and devops positions to work on LivePlan, a rapidly-growing business planning application for small and medium businesses.
React, Flux, Java, AWS, lots of other cool stuff. Good environment, good people, and it's not the Bay Area so that's like an automatic 1.5x multiplier to the salary right off the bat.
Just because it's hard to search for "OR" sometimes I'm going to specifically spell out "Oregon".
We're using React/Flux on the front end, Java on the back end. Lots of cool problems to solve in the coming months.

Our team is small and agile (currently 7 engineers) but with the backing of one of the world's largest professional services firms, PwC.
We're looking for:
- frontend and backend software engineers
- DevOps engineers
- a product-focused engineering manager
- data integrators (client facing, still technical)
to be part of a small but growing engineering team in a "startup in the enterprise" type of setting.

Ideally, you will have experience in building scalable web applications and/or data analytics solutions. You should have experience with some of our tech stack:
- Python, Java, Javascript, SQL
- Kafka, Spark, Google BigQuery, Cassandra, Elasticsearch, MySQL
- Ansible, Google Cloud Platform
- Information security topics, log aggregators (e.g., fluentd, logstash), data analytics
You must be comfortable with:
- linux shell
- cloud infrastructure
- git
Email me at kevin dot schumacher at pwc.com if you are interested in discussing any of these roles (please put "HN" in the subject - no recruiters, please).

Permutive (YC S14) — London, UK — http://permutive.com — ONSITE
We're focused on understanding and recommending content at scale. We use ML/NLP techniques to algorithmically understand the meaning behind content and make sense of people's wide and nuanced interests based on their behavior. Engaging content is the future of online monetization, and we're building the intelligent infrastructure for deploying revenue-generating content.
We have a ton of interesting problems to solve. We're constantly ingesting vast numbers of documents to learn from, tracking millions of interactions with content, computing the interests of millions of users, and making personalized real-time recommendations. This scale impacts every engineering decision we make, and we're looking to build a company with people excited by the challenges it poses.
You'll want to have interests or experience in some of the following:
* Working extensively in functional languages (we mostly use Scala, with Akka, Spray, Scalaz; some Haskell).
* Building large-scale distributed systems (we run a microservices architecture on AWS)
* Designing and implementing proprietary machine learning models and real-time personalized recommendation systems
* Rapidly designing and building front-end products (HTML/CSS, React, etc.)
We're a VC and Y Combinator-backed startup at the beginning of our journey. As one of our first engineers you'll play a central role in defining our tech culture and direction. There's a huge opportunity to effect change at scale through real responsibility and ownership of product. And because at this early stage there's so much to do, there's so much to learn and room to grow.

Pathgather | New York, NY | onsite preferred, will consider remote
Pathgather is Techstars NYC company building an enterprise learning platform that - unlike traditional learning systems forced on employees - is one you'll actually enjoy using. We’re solving a big problem felt by almost all growing companies: how to continuously train and educate your workforce with modern/relevant content.
One way we're doing that is through the flexibility in our platform, which supports a variety of integrations. Because of that, we deal with lots of APIs.
We're looking for an API expert to join our small but growing team. You'll own the API we provide to companies like Qualcomm, Walmart, and Twitter, and you'll help expand our suite of 3rd party integrations. You'll have significant impact on every customer deployment and the opportunity to interface with the talented engineers consuming our APIs.
About You
- You're an API expert. You of course prefer JSON REST APIs but can deal with an XML SOAP API if need be.
- You understand and have opinions on common API authentication methods like OAuth, JWT, etc
- You understand SQL (ideally Postgres). Maybe you've worked with ORMs like ActiveRecord and/or Sequel.
- You have experience with Ruby/Rails (or a similar language)
- Perhaps you've dealt with Redis and Elasticsearch too, but if you haven't, no worries. We'll give you the chance to in any case.
Responsibilites
- Lead and develop integrations that enhance our learning content offerings to our customers
- Enhance the API we provide to our customers (docs.pathgather.com). Some of the functionality you might add include analytics reporting and bulk creates/updates.
- Help define the strategy for the launch of a Pathgather partner program/platform. This project would allow partnered content vendors to integrate with Pathgather in a variety of ways via defined standards and API communications.
If you're interested, please contact me at jamie@pathgather.com. We have a great work environment in our Union Square office and would love for you to be a part! You can also see more about us and what we offer at https://angel.co/pathgather/jobs

Collective Health, ( http://collectivehealth.com/ ), San Mateo, CA (Full time, ONSITE only)
We're tackling the employer-sponsored healthcare industry (our favorite analogy is how Tesla takes on several verticals at once, such car makers, dealers as well as the oil industry). We can lower both the first and second derivative of the rising health care cost curve, nationwide. There's some compelling evidence we can do so, if you'd like to chat.
The company just under a year and half old. We punch well above our weight-class with experienced founders, 60+ team members (~ one quarter is engineering), and paying customers.
If you're interested in some challenging work, you should let me know. We've got a ton of interesting problems to solve around distributed systems, data analytics and predictions, complex data modeling, ultra high-availability, security, privacy and more. We're currently looking for experienced SW engineers up and down the stack, back end, infrastructure, data, dev ops, test, generalist, etc.
Our tech stack is a mix of Go and Java components with Angular on the front end. We use a custom service bus to tie our SOA together, microservices style. We love Docker, CoreOS, postgres, riak, automated testing, and continuos integration.
As a company, we're strong believers in transparency, trust and balance. As an engineering team, we believe good code is easy to read and should have a short "time to understanding". We expect all of our engineers to continually teach as well as learn. We also believe that everyone should write good code, yet balance that against the need to ship.
https://jobs.lever.co/collectivehealth
We're super proud of the company mission, engineering culture and tech stack we've put together and would love a chance to explain it all in detail!

Software Engineers - On-Site, Cardiff, South Wales, UK - Sorenson Media
We're looking to hire multiple Software Engineers for roles which will be mostly writing Javascript, both server side (Node.js) and client side. You do not need any Javascript experience to apply (we've hired many people without it) we find it easier to teach good engineers Javascript then to teach Javascript developers good software engineering skills.
We're hiring developers for our Spark Enhance product: http://www.sorensonmedia.com/spark/enhance/
We work in an Agile environment with daily Scrums, Retrospectives and 2 week sprints (though some teams have been experimenting with Kanban) and a real focus on the Engineering department owning the Engineering processes which means you get to spend your time writing code and have the autonomy to try changes to the processes and see if they work.
We're looking for multiple engineers with a range of experience levels (from recent grads to Senior Developers) so I can't specify specific salaries but I think they tend to be higher than most other Cardiff companies.
If any of this sounds interesting then feel free to contact me at mgrover@sorensonmedia.com with any questions, CVs, github profiles etc.

We are hiring full stack software engineers and a senior frontend engineer (Backbone, Angular, etc.) to join our engineering team of 8.
We are predominately in the JavaScript/Node.js ecosystem, but have developed a microservice architecture that gives us immense flexibility in our choice of languages and tools.

It's collaborative and challenging, and very rewarding.
In addition to competitive salary, comprehensive health benefits, and equity in an early-stage startup, you will have the opportunity to make an impactful contribution to both the product and the team. You will also get to work with some extremely talented and friendly folks who come from diverse backgrounds and experiences. We're learning a lot from each other.

Zenefits | San Francisco, CA | Software Engineer | Full Time, Onsite | https://secure.zenefits.com/jobs/57437?gh_jid=57437&gh_src=b...
Zenefits is a disruptive, well-funded startup that provides an all-in-one HR solution for small businesses. It's also one of the fastest growing SAAS businesses in history! Companies who join Zenefits are able to consolidate their many HR systems into one easy-to-use place, the Zenefits dashboard, where they can also secure and manage benefits for their employees. Zenefits the product is fast moving, and the engineering team is growing fast! There's still a lot of work to be done, and the projects we work on are high-impact projects with a tangible effect on the business. I haven't been here long, but so far it's clear that the perks are great, the people are of the highest quality, and there's a great culture of transparency and shared ownership. Experience with Python/Django and Ember.js are by no means necessary, but certainly won't hurt.

Software Engineer | True Link Financial | San Francisco, CA
Did you ever want the code you write to make the world a better place?
We are a young startup focused on protecting the elderly and other underserved communities from financial abuse. Our first offering is a pre-paid debit card that blocks undesirable transactions in real-time.
At its core, it’s a Java server connected to the major card networks with multiple instances spread geographically. It responds in 10-20ms, and has to stay that tight for us to grow. Understanding distributed systems (construction, diagnosis, and management) is key.
We also have a large Rails stack for our customers and our own rapidly evolving business. Join us, and you can touch it all: front-end, back-end, asynchronous queue-driven workers, real-time rules processing, complex calculation engines, mobile, etc.
All of this great technology helps make someone have a better day. We offer a mixture of salary and equity, and the chance to work with an amazing team of people across a range of disciplines. If all of that sounds good to you, let’s talk.
Because of the stage of the company we unfortunately cannot consider candidates with minimal experience (e.g. recent dev bootcamp graduates). We need people that have professional experience working as an engineer. We are also only looking to make an in-house, full-time hire here in San Francisco and cannot support part-time, remote, or contract work at this time. To apply for a job, email jobs@truelinkfinancial.com.

Grasswire is an open source news source that anyone can edit.
Grasswire is "open source" both in the sense that any of the content (photos, videos, text, tweets and videos) on Grasswire can be edited by anyone at any time, and in the sense that the code used to run the site will soon be on GitHub for anyone to play with. We'll be pushing the full Grasswire live in a couple weeks, and have an excited user base anxiously waiting. We're playing with some stuff on the current https://grasswire.com now, so you can check that out, but the next iteration will be quite different.
Our backend is built in Scala, and use the Play framework as our front end templating engine, but this position will be mostly working with our senior web developer in HTML/CSS(SASS)/Javascript (jQuery and AJAX). This would be a great position for someone who is good with JS and really looking to cut their teeth and get used to shipping quickly and iteratively. We try to ship daily to production.

Interested in working with mobile devices for large scale SLAM?
Occipital is a small company looking for more 3D Computer Vision Developers.

Last year, we launched Structure Sensor, the first depth sensor for mobile (http://structure.io, http://kck.st/16BkwuO).
However, fundamentally Occipital is a software company (http://occipital.com/about), and we dedicate a lot of efforts on research in mobile computer vision software. We’ve already released early prototypes of real-time object scanning, indoor mapping and augmented reality demos, but we want to push the boundaries of computer vision much further and enable practical 3D vision on mobile devices.
Additionally, we are interested in people who are passionate about creating applications that exist in the real 3D environment around us, including Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality, and are comfortable in exploiting the latest advances in Computer Vision. We regularly accept internships.

Maybe you’re a developer who already loves funnel optimisation, tech driven SEO and reads patio11 for fun. Whatever the reason you're a developer who gets excited by the prospect of tech-driven marketing.
We’re hiring a full-stack developer to take ownership of the marketing parts of our platform. You can either sit within the marketing team or the tech team or split your time between both.
You’ll help us build a killer marketing website, figuring out how we can build visualisations customers love and how to optimise the user journey.
When you deploy code you’ll make a direct impact to the bottom line of the company. And not in a fluffy way. You’ll get to see exactly how many extra users and how much extra revenue your changes bought in.
We’re a p2p lender that's helped small businesses with over £400m of financing so far. You’ll help us take it to a billion.
We expect most of the work to be front-end. Turning wireframes into awesome HTML5/CSS, making Javascript dance and generally make our website into a great experience for our users (the backend is PHP but we're language-agnostic). We'll have in-house graphics & UX designers (we’re hiring for those roles too; tell your friends) but if you want more ownership of the design that’s also on the table.

Klets (https://klets.com) | Eindhoven, the Netherlands, Customer Support & Happiness | INTERN, ONSITE
At Klets we bring customer chat to all businesses in the world. We believe that chat is a great communication medium but it's underused for communication between companies and their customers. Especially B2B companies nearly exclusively use phone and email, and this is simply because there have been no good chat-based solutions to fill this gap. Klets fixes this. We launched a month ago and are seeing impressive traction and adoption.
We're looking for an intern who wants to make our existing and potential customers extremely happy. Your role will be very flexible and very much open to your own wishes and (study) needs. It's a plus if you have a clue about online marketing and can write (blog) well. You'll be studying something related to marketing, business or communication right now, and we'll tune the opening to match your studies. The fact that you, a non-programmer, are looking on Hacker News for internships gives you an immediate edge.
Most of our customer support (obviously) goes over chat, so it's important that you enjoy chat and text messaging. We find that customer support via Klets makes complete strangers have fun and crack jokes with you, so it's certainly a fun job. We'd also love for you to contribute to our marketing strategy if that's up your alley - content marketing, growth hacks - anything you can think of, really.
We'd like you to live relatively nearby but we're open to a big part of your work to take place remotely if necessary. So if you're in (or near) the Netherlands but not near Eindhoven, no biggie, with a combination of trains and remote work we'll make things work just fine.
We're a very young startup, and in our stage, there is no real difference between sales and customer support, and even marketing (because a great product with great support tends to market itself to some extent). If you're looking for a place to really significantly contribute to a startup's growth, get in touch.
Interested? Chat with us on https://klets.com/klets (no login or signup needed)

Bonanza.com is looking for a full-stack developer with the grit to hack on Ruby/Rails at scale. We serve nearly 50,000 merchants, helping them sell 15 million items across numerous buying channels. Measured by visitor traffic, we are one of the highest volume Rails installations in Seattle.
The Full Stack Developer at Bonanza will work across a variety of projects, gravitating toward those that are most stimulating for them. Our philosophy is that developers are most productive when they are given projects that best combine their talents & interests.
Because of this customization between "person" and "projects," it is difficult to prescribe in advance the specific tasks that will comprise this job. But here is a representative sample of the challenges we're working on:
* How can we make a buyer's search experience as relevant as possible when 50,000 items match their query?
* How can we build the stickiest possible mobile buyer experience? Does that vary on tablets?
* What's it like to use the best toolset for managing an inventory of 100,000 items?
* Can we use natural language recognition to estimate the selling price of an item based on its title and category?
* What is the sexiest layout for a webstore theme?
Our challenges range up and down the stack, in a variety of technologies. If you like working at scale, to make improvements in the lives of entrepreneurs, there's plenty for us to get done together.

Datanyze | San Mateo, CA | All positions, from product to sales
Hello, everyone! Jon from Datanyze, here. We just had our best month and best quarter EVER and are excited to continue growing throughout the second half of the year. We've gone from 6 to 45 employees in the last 12 months and are looking for our third office in less than a year...to say we're growing quickly is an understatement!
We're looking for amazing people in all functions, including but not limited to ENGINEERS (who doesn't need a great engineer or two these days?), account executive, sales development reps, customer success managers, designers...and pretty much everything in between!
We're not your average startup that swings between raising rounds and burning through piles of cash; we bootstrapped to over $1 million in ARR (annual recurring revenue) and 100 customers before raising a seed round from amazing investors like Google Ventures, Mark Cuban, and IDG Ventures.
If you're interested in hearing more about us and the roles we're trying to fill, send me an email directly to jon@datanyze.com!

Slickdeals | Las Vegas, NV | Onsite & Full Time
Like most mobile apps built in the past few years when starting up, a lot of shortcuts were made, optimizing for speed to market instead of the best user experience. Our current app was built by a 3rd party vendor. This just doesn't work anymore.
We started taking ownership of our app last year when we hired brilliant & passionate Mobile PM, iOS developer, and Android developer. We're currently in the final stages of rebuilding both our iOS & Android apps from the ground up, fixing the mistakes of the past. It has been a lot of work for everyone, but the end result will be worth it.
Although the job post is for someone who does both iOS & Android apps, don't let that deter you. We're not going to pass up on a talented and passionate iOS or Android developer

Python/Javascript/Full-Stack | UtilityAPI.com | Oakland, CA | ONSITE | Solar Job
=Description=
We are a white-label SaaS that is used by solar and energy efficiency companies to collect their customer's utility bill and usage data automatically. We write scripts that collect data from utilities, and these scripts can break unexpectedly when utilities change their interfaces, so being able to update them quickly is important. You will be working in our office at the SfunCube in downtown Oakland alongside me and our other two software engineers. Our codebase is well organized, documented, and tested.
=Jobs=
* Full-Stack Engineer ($120-140k) - You will be writing application code and helping maintain/optimize/scale the stack. At least 5 years of Python and Linux sysadmin experience required.
* Python/Javascript Developer ($80-120k) - You will be writing tools, scripts, and libraries that collect/parse utility data (pdfs, html, xml, csv, etc.) from utilities. At least 1 year of Python and Javascript experience required.
=How To Apply=
Email me, Daniel Roesler, a cover letter and a PGP-encrypted pdf resume. Please include links to your github, bitbucket, or personal side project website (for reference, mine is daylightpirates.org). You must already be able to work in the U.S.
=For Solar Skeptics=
In the last few years, the solar industry reached "grid parity", which means that the unsubsidized installed cost is now cheaper than buying power from the grid. That's why this industry is the fastest growing industry in the country. This isn't some subsidy-dependent industry anymore. We work hard and we make real money (while conveniently also saving the planet).

If you were responsible for shipping and maintaining the product for a few years, we really want to talk to you.

TrueCar is hiring Rails, Python, mobile (iOS and Android), and devops engineers in Santa Monica, San Francisco, and Austin. We're also hiring designers.
We acquired the talent of quite a few Carwoo (YCS09) alums a little over a year ago.
We've been around for 10 years and went public 1 year ago. The company has big plans for the coming years and is looking for good developers to help us grow from $1.5B to $10B+.
See http://truecar.com/hiring.html for the full scoop.
We're using Rails and Python (Flask) to serve out all kinds of APIs as well as consumer-facing web experiences and internal tools.
Let's see; what else?
* We prefer you work with us in-person in Santa Monica, San Francisco, or Austin. Remote definitely considered for the right candidates, but you must be based in the United States. We'll handle most visa situations.
* Benefits are exceptional: health premiums are 100% paid for (not only for you, but your whole family), we match your 401k (up to 3% of your contributions), and give stock options and performance bonuses. We also pay for your gym membership (up to $50/month) and have catered lunches every Wednesday.
* Our Santa Monica HQ is right by the beach and Third Street Promenade, so expect fresh air and plenty of food options. While our SF office is right off the Montgomery BART station with 360 degree views of downtown and the bay.
* A meaningful subset of some of the technologies we use: Ruby on Rails, Python, Flask, Redis, MySQL, Hadoop, and Elasticsearch (the whole ELK stack).
* VISAS are handled and remote options are available under the right circumstances.

So we work with educational institutions to help them launch, run, and market their schools — and make sure they’re compliant with government regulations along the way.
One of the things we offer is customized software solutions that make it easy for institutions to track and teach students, and for regulatory agencies to track institutions. Right now, we’re looking for a full time Ruby on Rails Developer to help build our next generation e-learning platform.
These are the skills we expect you to have: Ruby Rails JavaScript HTML CSS (SASS) jQuery (Backbone.js or Ember.js a plus) SQL (PostgreSQL a plus) Git API development Browser compatibility issues Deployment methodologies (e.g. Capistrano) Database/query optimization

REDWOOD CITY, CA
ONSITE but we do offer RELOCATION and VISA sponsorship
tl;dr - We’re profitable, pride ourselves on a supportive company culture, and hiring across the board. EdTech.
Course Hero is looking for engineers who can hit the ground running in a variety of roles:
★ Full-stack web
★ iOS
★ Android
We’re also hiring in product and marketing.
Our team releases code every day to millions of people, so we're looking for someone who can take on challenges, build new features, and iterate quickly. Each engineer has a role in building Course Hero's architecture and will have the opportunity to touch all parts of the stack. Our projects are big but our team is small, so you’ll see projects from start to finish, working closely with product managers and designers to ensure successful results.
Our company culture is very open, flat, and transparent. We succeed and learn together. Our office is very comfortable, has a lot of natural light, and great amenities like a gym and walking trails onsite. We’ve tried hard to make this a pleasant and inspiring place to do creative work.
Most importantly, we seek to hire individuals whose personality, integrity and passion for our business make our team better as a whole. We’re growing fast, profitable (yes, it’s true!), and looking for another core team member to push us toward the future.
For mobile, we’re focused on iOS and Android for now. Our web stack is LAMP (Symfony/PHP) + jQuery and AngularJS, but we’re open to people with all kinds of experience.
Please, no recruiters. Principals only.

UI/Visual Designer
We believe your debit card should work more like an app, and we're building the software to make that a reality. Programmable limits, auto reload, data visualization, etc. We recently closed a $5M series A to make this happen.
Many of these features are early in their life, so the UI/Visual designer is going to have a very large say in what they become.
We believe design should be practical and beautiful, in that order.
We're looking for a designer that's principled - with strong ideas about what makes an execution "good", and pragmatic - with the ability to foresee and accommodate edge cases and implementation gotchas.
We're a small team, so the right designer has a mix of narrow expertise and broad knowledge.

US – We are RIFT.io and we're looking for talented people. There are very few opportunities where you get to be a part of something ground breaking and on a global level; this is one of those moments. In less than one year of the company being founded, we built a product, acquired 5 customers (three of them on the Fortune 500), and finished out 2014 with 40 employees. 2015 has already turned into an exciting year; we've picked up another handful of customers, we're on track to double by the end of the year and we come out of stealth mode.
LIFE – Work life here at RIFT.io is everything you imagined it could be. We have every snack and beverage you can think of. Can't find what you're looking for? Ask our snacks committee and they'll make sure it's stocked by the end of the week. We have some intense ping pong, corn hole, and Smash Brothers matches. But above all that, we have passion. It's exuded by the amazing and talented people who work here. This isn't your typical punch in punch out job; our employees come in early and stay late. It's because of that dedication we cater dinners and make an effort to stop and eat with one another. This is a 'douche-bag free' zone. We respect all ideas and all people who come through our front doors who are here to learn, contribute, and inspire. The pedigree of our leadership is amazing; founded, IPO'd and sold a company. They believe in the employees that work here and give them every opportunity and tool needed to be successful in this venture.
WORK – We're still in stealth, so I can't say much. What I can tell you is that you will be working on is something that has global impact, has never been done to this degree, and has to happen for technology to progress the way it is. The work is challenging and intense.

As our user-base continues to grow, we are looking for an outstanding Front-end focused engineer to help us scale up our community and continue to improve our product.
On-site full-time presence in NY is preferred but we are open to other arrangements for outstanding candidates. You will be joining a very small engineering team and will have the opportunity to make a huge impact on the organization and the product. If you care about food and improving our broken food system, and want to work with fun, smart, pragmatic, motivated people, please get in touch.
Our stack is HTML, CSS, JS, Ember, Cordova, Objective C (iOS), Ruby/Rails/Postgres/Heroku. Experience with these specific technologies is a plus, but not required.

Australia / Remote - Karma (https://www.karma.wiki)
Frontend Engineer Needed to Help Change the World
My name's Dayne, I'm a programmer from South Africa currently living in Canberra, Australia. Last year my brother and I started working on a project with the potential to radically shift culture in the direction of openness and accountability.
In the last 6 months we’ve built an incredible team (including an ex Google & Quora senior programmer, and some great tech entrepreneurs and CEOs), completed our MVP designs, launched a prototype, and secured seed investment.
Our plan is to demonstrate traction in Australia over the next few months, and migrate to San Francisco in late 2015 or early 2016. Our company is already incorporated in Delaware, and we’re hoping that with traction and growth we’ll get accepted into YC’s next batch.
We’re looking for someone with exceptional skills and experience in:
  - HTML5
  - CSS
  - AngularJS
  - Bootstrap
  - Ideally experience with: Grunt, TDD, Go, Cassandra (or other NoSQL).
Personality traits and experience we’re looking for:
  - Hard working & 100% honest
  - Passionate about freedom of speech & information. If you think that the EU's "Right to Be Forgotten" legislation is a good thing, or that Assange and Snowden are bad guys, you probably won't like what we're doing.
  - Must be smart. We’re looking for someone who could have created the frontend for sites like AirBnB, Quora, etc. The interview process will include a programming and logic interview with an ex-Google senior programmer.
  - Must show evidence of having worked on a project from start to finish.
  - Extensive experience is not necessary - our priority is building a team of smart people who share our passion for Karma.
  - Must be willing to relocate to San Francisco.
We are offering a salary as well as potential to earn equity in the company for the right applicant. If you’re interested, please send a resume/CV/letter/demo to dayne@karma.wiki.
Thanks, Dayne

Badoo, London
https://corp.badoo.com/jobs/?jvi=oHWj1fwH,Job
We are currently developing an in-house logging flow that traps hundred of thousands mobile client side events per second, aggregates, processes and stores them in HDFS using Python and Spark, then shows reports and visualisations on our React based portal using D3.
You, the Ideal Candidate, are a passionate and thorough individual who could contribute to the development of some components of this system. You must love exploring new tools, libraries and technologies in various programming languages, but also should convince us you are able to maintain larger and longer term projects. You can write easily understandable code that is so good that even your grandchildren will be using it. In the past you already worked with large volumes of data, experienced scalability problems and explored various data streaming and storage systems to understand their benefits and limitations.
You must have experience in JavaScript and Python, and you should be really good (better than us) in one of those. Experience in one of the JVM based languages is a huge plus. If you also have any side projects or open source contributions, that will be more than welcome.
We assume you know how to work with git, JIRA, regular expressions, etc. Apart from this, you should be really good at unix commands and SQL queries. Every day you will meet and talk with nice and friendly people who are using the system, so you should be good at explaining new features, showing new joiners how to start using it and explaining why things are not working in case of failure.
Badoo is a great company to work in. It gives you everything you need in order to enhance your skills. The problems we are solving are interesting and the tools we are choosing are cutting edge. We will be sending you to conferences and workshops, buying breakfasts and lunches, books and software for you.

I have recently taken up a role to build a payment network from scratch, out of Bangalore, India. It is funded by a big corporation, but will be arms-distance from their central business.
It is a large, complex and fascinating problem to crack. The potential to bring banking to 600 million un/underbanked Indians is what excited me to work on this.
In the past I have built both fast-data and big-data companies and have a few patents in this space.
We are looking to hire a good core team of full time math, physics and CS majors, UI UX and product managers, who will work of Bangalore, India.
If you are interested, please email me at google's email service - takenottie. Thanks for reading.

Software Engineers - Gametime - San Francisco, CA
Gametime connects communities through frictionless and beautiful mobile applications. We believe communities get closer when people get off the couch and have fun at a live event. Backed by Accel Partners as well as team owners Jeff Mallett (Giants / Whitecaps / Derby FC), Vivek Ranadive (Kings), and David Blitzer (76ers / Devils) we've raised $13mm (including $8mm in May of 2015).
Built for iOS and Android, Gametime makes getting into the game as amazing as being there. Inside gametime.co/app we provide high-res panoramic photos from every section, curated listings as we decrease a universe of 5000 options to the 50 best with ultra fast two-tap checkout and no printing . With our mobile-only approach, we've reduced a 30-minute process to 30 seconds. This approach has led to fast (600% annual) and viral (92% of new purchasers hear about the app from friends) growth.
New Gametimers join for the community of high-performers (known as the Gameteam). New employees also love the environment as we aspire to build the best place to work in SF ...
We offer market rate salary (even though we’re small) and real equity (meaning you come out way ahead). Everyone here does meaningful work. You won't end up on the "login button team" here, you will be a big part of the most important conversations on the engineering team. There’s free catered lunch Monday through Friday! Who said there was no such thing? We offer Blue Cross / Blue Shield via Zenefits and dental insurance. We also have monthly $75 cell phone reimbursement and $80 commuter benefit. We love going to games and we're right by AT&T Park so (if you're into it) you'll hit a bunch of them with us. Go Giants!
In summary, we're fast, well-funded and growing quickly. It's an exciting time to join the Gameteam.

Our team is optimized for developer impact and freedom.
* A TRULY REMOTE job. We've taken Jason Fried's TED talk [1] to heart and built an entirely distributed team, which includes even our CEO. We have no physical office for employees to report to just in case you're worried about bait and switch ;)
* Flexible work schedules. Work the times that work best for you. Our team cares about what gets done, not about how many hours you stare at your screen.
* No wire frames, pixel perfect designs, or 35 page specs handed down from out of touch product managers. We trust our engineers to help define business needs and shape them.
* Engineers get to take an idea from conception all to way to production, coupled with a team support system to get feedback and iterate until you've built a something we're all proud of.
* Friendly, funny, energetic co-workers.
* Our company is profitable and growing.
We want team members we can trust, who not only care deeply about well written and tested code, but our business as well. Be ready to learn, grow, and help the team do great things together. Send us an email, we'd love to hear from you: jobs@nakedapartments.com

My name is Joe Charat. I’m on the team at Naked Apartments. Thanks for taking the time to read and comment on our job post. I see in one of your previous HN comments that you are or were a “product manager at a tech company.” Given that role, I can understand why you might disagree with our organizational structure.
How teams are comprised is certainly an important decision for any company, but there are many ways of going about it. Countess companies have succeeded with product managers leading or working alongside developers, and countless companies have succeeded without product managers. We happen to be in the latter category.
And for what it’s worth, we’re doing quite well.

Could you please comment on salary ranges? Barcelona seems a nice place to live, but low salaries (and high prices) compared to northern Europe is concerning.
reply

soci 2 hours ago

Very low salaries for tech jobs in Barcelona are a thing from the past. Now there's high competition in the city to attract the best talent.
For instance, Senior Rails or Symfony Backend Engineer market salary is around 45K € [1]. I've seen job offers at the job board I maintain (www.jobsbcn.com) offering up to 70K€ salary for these positions.
Nevertheless, it's not all about the money, flexible working hours and many other perks are also offered at many Startups.
Also, working next to the beach and having a swim at lunch time (I've been working in one of those companies...) or being less than a two hour drive from ski resorts is a plus you cannot disregard, specially if your city of origin does not offer these qualities.
[1] Please, let me clarify that 45K is not as much as you would be paid in Berlin. Also, housing is cheaper there too. But those are different cities with different things to offer.

I'm sorry but at this point, I cannot. But we're having market level salaries for Barcelona and the low salary/high prices you mention is simply not true.

OK, thanks.
I got contacted by your HR staff a while ago, but I am getting kind of annoyed by the "just complete this coding test / large online form" before technical staff will even speak to me.
Its definitely put me off applying to a few places recently as I don't want to spend an hour and a half just to get a chance to interview somewhere.
reply

diggan 4 days ago

The form would take you a couple of minutes to complete. Also, the test we have currently, doesn't take more than one hour if you know what you're doing. Then you get to speak with the appropriate team.
We know that we're not the best in our application process but since we have a lot of applicants, we need to try to save our own time as well as the candidates time. Hence, a very short and simple test for people to complete.
Anyways, thanks for the feedback, it'll help us to our process smoother.

Within engineering we are a passionate group of people who are extremely interested in building the software that helps our customers around the country thrive in their local communities. We’re a pretty small team (currently 14 people) so you’ll have plenty of say around how we develop software going forward.
We are currently in the process of modernizing our software platform to be more modular and truly data driven. Our goal is to use data to make sure that we provide the right content to the right consumer at the right time. We’re building our internal API using REST based services implemented in Java, and while our front end is currently implemented in PHP, we are migrating away from that. Some of the technologies that we’re using: Dropwizard, Swagger, Flyway, AngularJS, Bootstrap, CloudFormation, Troposphere, and Ansible. All new engineers get company provided downtown parking, flexible work hours, 100% of their health insurance premiums paid for by the company, the ability to build their own work computer, and access to our kitchen with plenty of drinks and snacks. We’re looking for individuals only so please NO RECRUITERS OR AGENCIES (seriously, your emails will just go into the trash folder so let's save each other's time). In addition we’re looking for full-time employees who are already in Austin, TX or willing to relocate.

Bayes Impact | Project Development Lead | San Francisco, CA | ONSITE
Bayes Impact is a technology nonprofit that uses data science to solve pressing social challenges across the globe. We build intuitive and powerful software applications that empower governments, nonprofits, and individuals to make critical, data-driven decisions. Our goal is to turn data into actions that impact the lives of billions of people. We believe that while technology shows tremendous promise when it comes to revolutionizing the social space, prototypes and proofs and concept are not useful unless they're actually implemented and as such we only focus on a small number of high impact, long term projects.
ABOUT THE ROLE
We are looking for an explorer and visionary to join our team and develop our next big projects. Can algorithms be used to save lives by reducing wait times for ambulance dispatch? Will better data systems improve transparency in the criminal justice system? Is data science the key to realizing the future of personalized health? You will identify big questions like these and answer them with game-changing technology solutions.
Our mission is not just to create reports and recommendations; we build production-level software applications and deploy them in the field. However, turning an idea into a full-fledged operational solution that could improve the lives of millions is no small feat. If you thrive in ambiguity and hustle by nature, this role is for you.
We are looking for someone who can become an overnight expert in social issues, build partnerships, engage researchers, convince funders, negotiate roadblocks, sizing up incumbents, identify relevant technologies, devise software solutions, and do whatever it takes to make things happen.
If you’re interested, please send us your resume and a bit about what you want in your work (/life/love/next meal/etc). Email us at careers@bayesimpact.org. We’ll listen and get back to you.

IBM Watson | Multiple positions | Pittsburgh | Onsite | Full-time | Citizen; Visa for well-qualified candidates | Scala; Java; Angular.js; Bootstrap; Python; Ruby; Watson Explorer
IBM Watson in Pittsburgh has several open positions as of this posting.
http://ibm.biz/watson-pgh-jobs
* Watson Technical Product Manager
* Watson User Interface (UI) Junior Developer
* Watson Quality Engineer
* Watson Support Explorer Engineer
If you apply, please ensure that you apply fully by clicking the link in the email you receive later today. People frequently miss that step and leave their application incomplete!
I’m the software engineer tech lead on the Watson Explorer connectivity team and former consultant with the product's Professional Services team.
We’re looking for folks versed in Java, Scala, and the Ruby on Rails stack. The UI positions are heavily focused on Angular.js and Bootstrap. QA leans Python. We're in new development mode right now, so if you like to start from nothing, you'll like what we're doing.
We do things like TDD, real actual pair programming†, kanban, agile-ish planning (IBM Design Thinking, not some convoluted buzzword bullshit), automated builds, “use the right tool for the job even if it’s not an IBM product”, and daily stand ups that, for the most part, never run past 15 minutes.
We like to have fun, too, having regular board game lunches and evenings, hosting meetup events, weekly communal lunch cooked by one or more of our fantastic cooks, and managers that are incredibly full-of-clue and treat us like the adults we all are.
We try to keep our interview process as bullshit-free as possible. If we think you look good on paper, we’ll reach out for a phone chat and give you the details on a pretty open-ended code test, where you’ll implement a simple library. If we like your solution, then we’ll invite you for a live culture fit and technical interview, in-person if you’re near or remote if not. This process has given us a ridiculously low turnover.
† no, really. We shoot for 50%-75% pairing, otherwise known as “pair when it makes sense”.

A previous posting:
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9639434
We've hired at least two people we contacted via HN.
You can read more in the many /r/pittsburghjobs posts I’ve made throughout the years both as IBM and as Vivísimo, the startup that IBM acquired in 2012:
https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburghjobs/comments/2xq5o9/ibm_...
We have award-winning engineers, writers, and speakers in our office. One of IBM Design’s principals is located here, too. A few of our staff are on conference organizing committees for Steel City Ruby, DevOps Days, SATURN, etc. Almost half of our desks are standing desks in our open space office plan (where sitting is fine, too!) with a roof deck in the middle of a bustling, multicultural business district.
If you’re physically in Pittsburgh, consider coming to a Code & Supply (http://www.codeandsupply.co) event held in our office. We host several per month; we’re very active in the local developer community. We've hired at least three people that we've met through it...
If you're not in Pittsburgh, you can click that above link and search for other cities. Most Watson positions have "Watson" in the title or at least as a keyword in the search. Or you can try through http://www.ibm.com/watsonjobs and just mention my username when formally applying.
I should mention that I get a copy of the email when you apply through this site, which asks the bare minimum necessary to get you into the pipeline. I don't get all of that information, but I do get at least your name and email address and I pass that information to the hiring manager, sometimes even walking over to them myself and saying, "LOOK AT THIS MAGNIFICENT PERSON. HIRE THEM. PLZ."
Applying above is not a black hole. Repeat: not a black hole. If you don't hear from me, you didn't complete the application process.

Zappos Labs - San Francisco, CA - ONSITE
Zappos Labs is looking for a Full-Stack Developer!
What is the job?
We are a small team of smart people looking to solve tough problems and brainstorm new ideas. Our projects focus on the future of Zappos and customer experiences using a combination of new technologies and new approaches to old technologies. As the Zappos Labs team, we have freedom to incubate new ideas with the backing of a large yet passionate-about-culture organization.
Some of our recent projects include researching new lines of business for Zappos, exploring the physical pop-up space, and creating the tools to support self-organization.
What skills do you need?
We are looking for an experienced full stack developer with a focus on front end development. Some of the technologies we use are Ruby on Rails, Javascript frameworks, Node, Mysql, Postgres, and R. We also have a mobile project or two going on at any point in time. Our general approach is language agnostic, choosing the best language for the job.
Being able to design applications from top to bottom, troubleshooting and fixing tough problems, hitting quick deadlines, knowing when to push back on requirements, and mentoring other developers will all be very important parts of this role. Knowing a programming language or two like the back of your hand will also come in very handy.
We are ideally looking for a "T-shaped developer"—someone who has a broad interest and understanding of technology and the web, but also has deep interest in a specialized area. However, being a Labs developer isn’t a full-time programming job. We want someone who has their own big ideas, loves brainstorming sessions, and will participate in user research.
What kind of people do we want?
Our team is always in search of people that are self-starters, visionary thinkers, and people who don’t mind a little bit of ambiguity.
There are many open ended problems that there are no solutions for...yet. Can you brainstorm and come up with innovative solutions to new problems? Are you willing to work closely in a small team and push everyone to be the best that they can be? Do you love learning new things, expanding your knowledge, and iterating quickly? If so, the Zappos Labs team might be for you.
Zappos IP, Inc. is an equal opportunity employer and a drug-free workplace

Nava | Washington DC* | Experienced full-stack developers/devops/product manager/operations | On-site - Full Time
I'm part of a small team of engineers from Silicon Valley that came out to DC last year to help fix Healthcare.gov. It turns out there’s a lot more to fix. And it’s surprising how much can be fixed by a small group of resourceful people with a Silicon Valley mindset, deep technical experience, and the willingness to work closely with dedicated civil servants in government.
Our revamped Healthcare.gov application has been used by millions, converts 35% better, and halves the completion time. The login system we rebuilt is about two orders of magnitude more reliable and two orders of magnitude less expensive; for example, it’s about $70M less per year to operate. We’re just getting started, and we’ve started Nava to help fix everything else. [0]
People die because the Veteran's Administration is months behind in processing claims. The Social Security Administration pays benefits to millions of deceased Americans. $80 billion is spent every year on federal IT contracting, and 96% of projects are deemed failures [1].
That’s not because there’s some conspiracy or because government is inherently incapable of doing it right. These are complicated legacy systems and processes, and there are very few people with modern tech industry experience who are aware of these problems and willing to help fix them. You can help change that.
Our team is 10 people (Stanford, Google, YC alums), and we plan to bring on a few people every month through 2015.
We’re looking for: - experienced full-stack engineers - experienced devops engineers - a product manager with a technical background - a hyper-resourceful operations person
We have a social mission (we just incorporated as a public benefit corporation (PBC) this week), but we pay market compensation (above market, for DC) and equity (above market).
If you'd like to build software and infrastructure that radically improves how our government serves people, we’d love to hear from you at jobs@navahq.com.
*Not in DC / able to relocate, but intrigued and in SF? Talk to us.

StitchFix - San Francisco, CA - [REMOTE OK] - http://stitchfix.com We're doing TONS of hiring, and solving some REALLY interesting problems. I just joined as Principal Engineer and I'm loving it. The business is an advanced algorithms & machine learning recommendation engine applied to a Women's Fashion e-commerce / subscription service. In english, we send our clients an outfit every few weeks, our algorithm and our stylists choose the perfect outfit for our customers, and they LOVE it. Just search instagram for hashtag "#stitchfix" and see how many of our customers post happy pictures of themselves receiving this month's "Fix'. Our customer referral-to-friend statistic is off the charts. We're hiring for these roles: Senior Full Stack Rails Engineer, Head of DevOps, Lead iOS Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Scientists, Product Designer, UX Designer On the business side, it's a startup but we're profitable and we're not planning on seeking additional funding! Its amazing to be part of a company that is experiencing so much growth and success. On the Engineering side, we're solving some really interesting problems. The Principal Engineer role which I just started is a very interesting type of position. We do not have Product Managers, and Principal Engineers are responsible for a part of the business (I'm responsible for part of the consumer facing web site). They are responsible for driving the product forward, working with all the stakeholders and then also implementing the solutions. I'm only 2 weeks in and I already think this is how all companies should operate (sorry PM's!) There is an entire separate department we call AA (Algorithms and Analytics), they are also hiring like crazy. They are working on really advanced machine learning recommendation algorithm and with every little improvement of the algorithm they can see real impact of increased sales and increase customer-sat (Tim Cook's favorite quotes stat, which stands for Customer Satisfaction) Anyway...don't let the industry put you off, the smartest, most driven but nicest people work here and you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you don't at least consider it :) Check out our engineering and algorithms web site: http://technology.stitchfix.com/ and here is our jobs page https://www.stitchfix.com/careers.

An excellent career move. The chance to work with great developers, in fact, great people across the board. The space to be trusted to do what you do best and to make decisions that matter. The potential to tackle big stuff, not small stuff. What do you need to apply? We’re looking for people across all levels of experience and we’re more concerned with what you can do than what you have done. As a minimum, a Computer Science degree or similar; experience in a web economy or other tech environment; proficiency in object-oriented programming, automated testing, front and back end web development and database technologies.

London, United Kingdom - Geckoboard - http://geckoboard.com - ONSITE (but some working from home is no problem)
Geckoboard is a successful, growing 25-person B2B SaaS startup based in East London. Our elegant, real-time dashboards solve a valuable, difficult problem for thousands of paying subscribers, by taking the complexity out of connecting to their data and making that data simple for anyone to interpret at a glance. As a result, our customers unlock data they didn't know they had, connect people and join up projects, and make better decisions faster.
We have a lot of exciting work ahead and are looking for curious and creative problem solvers to help develop our product and take it to even more customers. You'll be joining a friendly team with great people in an environment with empowered developers, flexible working conditions, and a focus on skill development.
We are looking for full-time senior engineers, both front- and back-end. A variety of skills for modern, scalable web applications - e.g. Chef, React, Go, Ruby, Javascript - are of interest, but we like to have people learn on the job so don't worry about any you might be missing. See our jobs page for details: https://www.geckoboard.com/careers/
We’re constantly striving to ensure that we offer the most encouraging, supportive and efficient environment possible. We want everyone on the team to influence our architectural decisions. The whole team is involved in prioritising and evaluating our work and we regularly program in pairs to share knowledge, promote collaboration, and improve our code quality.
We don't just pay lip service to work-life balance, we actively and strongly encourage it. Flexible working hours and the ability to regularly work from home let you work in a way that fits you and your family.

Connexity - Camarillo, CA (Los Angeles area) | on-site | http://connexity.com
Are you interested in learning advertising tech from the inside out? We're looking for a talented software engineer who takes their personal development seriously and seeks to make a huge impact.
You'll be working alongside a small, driven team right in the heart of the profit center. Our division of Connexity works in online display advertising through RTB, and we run 50 to 100 million impressions each day. Our total transaction volume is between 5 and 10 billion per day, and I'd bet you a beer we've served ads on nearly every site you've ever visited.
We're primarily looking for someone to contribute to our Rails app. It's used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites. It's not just boring CRUD. It's the heart of our display advertising business. The business folks will know you, and you'll find that excellence will stir up a tremendous amount of appreciation for your work.
This role is a great way to learn advertising tech at scale as well as other tools. In addition to Rails work, you'd get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, R and Scala. Several on the team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C, sophisticated reporting pipelines or novel optimization algorithms). It's really possible to get bored around here unless you're a boring person.
Our team is sharp and works well together. We enjoy perks such as daily paid lunch, a 9/80 schedule (to get every other Friday off) and unlimited vacation; the culture of our team recognizes and respects the importance of your non-work life. Also, Ventura county is a pretty nice place to live/work (unless you hate temperate coastal weather). If you've got Rails or other relevant web app experience, that's a good start. More importantly, you'll be eager to learn display advertising inside and out. Attitude, ambition and sound judgement trump experience with a specific set of tools.
We're a small team within a medium-sized organization, and we work hard to keep the small-team vibe while availing ourselves of the best bits from the mother ship.
Unless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a lead engineer on the team) at david.larsen@connexity.com.

San Francisco, CA - Onsite - Shyp
Need to mail something? Don't worry about boxing up your packages or finding the best deal. Request a pickup in the Shyp app, we'll pick it up from you, package it and find the best deal out of UPS, Fedex & USPS to get your items to their location safely, cheaply & on time.
5 server-side engineers are serving operations in 4 cities. We just raised $50m and we're looking for engineers to help us expand.
Lots of interesting problems to work on, including:
- Warehouse optimization
- Driver dispatch/routing optimizations
- Figuring out the best carrier for a given package
- Communicating sundry shipping options across different carriers in a standard way
- People ship a lot of interesting stuff! Tons of opportunity to give everyone a great experience at scale, no matter what they're sending.
Some of the benefits of the job:
- No waking up in the middle of the night! Open hours are 8am to 8pm.
- Whatever laptop setup you want.
- We host tech talks over lunch twice a month - have had people from Bugsnag, Stripe, Twitter, Medium, ngrok, and Layer come give talks in the past four months.
- $400 a year in travel credit, we want you to get away
- Daily Volume (compared to tweets or push notifications or text messages) is low, so systems aren't constantly falling over or about to.
- Our data is stored in Postgres, no worries about writes being acked and not actually saved.
- Servers/stored data are all UTC :)
- No long hours - pretty much everyone leaves the office at 6pm sharp.
- Really generous health/dental/vision coverage
- Office is about two blocks from Montgomery BART, lots of food/culture options nearby.
- We'll help you relocate to SF

Weeby.co is looking for a C++ Engineer | ONSITE (Mountain View, CA) | FULL TIME | engineering@weeby.co
We are changing the way people build games. We believe that non-zero compile times when iterating on a game are unacceptable, that the right tools can turn a single developer into an entire game studio, and that drop-in social experiences provide them with the best user acquisition and re-engagement strategy in the industry. The Tealeaf team builds the runtime that makes that all possible.
Responsibilities You will be part of our team building Tealeaf, the HTML5 runtime that powers all Weeby games on iOS and Android. You will contribute to features like on-device remote debugging from your desktop browser, remote application loading, CanvasRenderingContext2D Path APIs, and the WebGLRenderingContext.
- Implementing DOM APIs in C++ and exposing them to the JavaScript runtime - Writing integration tests in JavaScript for new APIs. A feature that isn’t tested isn’t done. - Code review other team member’s features and fixes
Qualifications You have experience with the following:
- writing concurrent C or C++ - binding native code with a JavaScript engine like v8 or SpiderMonkey - writing JavaScript - implementing vector graphics rendering algorithms - OpenGL ES, WebGL - WebIDL, experience implementing/maintaining C++ code generator - Knowledge/experience with blink dev-tools protocol
Why you should join
We build the tools to make building fun games easy, and we have fun while we build them. The code we write spans several domains which makes for intellectually stimulating days. When we need a break from the keyboard we compete in an office ping pong ladder, get coffees and dine down the block. For fun we have team BBQs, weekly team dinners and enjoy weekly game nights joined by friends and the StartX community.
We offer competitive salaries (weeby 250k) and equity.

Scribd (YC '06, "Netflix for eBooks", top 100 website, 50 people) is hiring talented hackers of all kinds to help us build the library of the 21st century.
We've hired EIGHT full-time people and TONS of interns from these "Who is Hiring" threads ... it really works!
We're looking for people who want to work with:
* Ruby on Rails (we're the #2 largest rails site, after Twitter)
* Javascript (well, we use Coffeescript)
* iOS OR Android (we're a top 10 eBook app with more reviews than Wikipedia, with a small mobile team)
* Data science / data analysis (using big data tools like hive to analyze an amazing proprietary dataset)
* Machine Learning / data mining / recommendations - think Netflix prize, but for books!
* Product manager and design (UI or UX) roles too
* Internships: junior standing or above for all areas of engineering. We hire several interns every summer and year-round.
That said, we care way more about your personality and general hacking skills then what languages you've used so far, so if you haven't used these but want to break into mobile or web development, this could be a good opportunity for you. We've hired people from these threads with everywhere from 0 to 10 years of experience.
We're profitable, very well funded and have a really fun office environment (in-office go-karts!) in the center of the startup world in San Francisco. Scribd alumni have gone on to found 4 other YCombinator companies, more than from any other startup. We think this says something about the kind of people that we like to hire, and we love hiring people with entrepreneur and startup ambitions. We are also always looking for international people interested in moving to the US and can help you secure a visa.
You can read more about our "Netflix for Books" service here http://wrd.cm/1dJquzz or check out our tech blog at http://coding.scribd.com. Last month we launched the first "Netflix for Comics" - really exciting stuff! More here: http://wrd.cm/1MbaBA6

I'm deeply sorry to hear this response.
It's true that I don't respond to every candidate, but I also never promised to. I DO read every single resume sent to me, guaranteed. Normally I just only reach out to people that I think are a good fit for us. I end up responding to at least a dozen candidates for each HN posting. Please keep in mind there is no automation here, and no recruiters - it's just me, and I have to balance running a company.
That said, you are 100% right that I should send at least some response to everyone, even people we aren't going to move forward with. I'm working on a process for this and will start doing it soon.
In the meantime, I want to personally apologize if you feel I wasted your time. If you want to send me a note via email I'm happy to give you some individual feedback on your application and why we didn't feel it was a good fit.

Princeton, NJ / Full Time / Onsite
The Department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University has an open position for an experienced software developer to work on the development of the scientific data processing pipelines for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). The role will involve working with Jim Bosch & John Swinbank within the Princeton Astronomical Data Group (led by Robert Lupton, Michael Strauss and Jim Gunn), which, in addition to LSST, is deeply involved in the Hyper Suprime Cam and Prime Focus Spectrograph instruments on the Subaru Telescope and expects to play a part in WFIRST, the space-based Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope.
The LSST will conduct the largest astronomical survey yet undertaken, observing a total of 20000 square degrees in six bands and around 1000 epochs, collecting over 50 PB of raw data and measuring the properties of 40 billion astronomical sources. Princeton is responsible for multi-epoch deep imaging and catalog production based on the LSST survey. All software written for LSST will be made freely available under an open source license; all data collected made publicly available within the US with no proprietary period.
This is a grant-funded, one-year term position with possibility of renewal.
We are seeking an experienced scientific software developer to contribute to the development of the scientific algorithms and supporting infrastructure. The ideal candidate would have at least 5 years of C++ expertise (required) and experience with collaborative software development in an astronomical environment (preferred). Knowledge of Python would be advantageous. An advanced degree in Physics, Astronomy, Computer Science or a related field, or equivalent practical experience is required.
We are seeking to recruit from as diverse a pool of talent as possible, and endeavor to preserve the Astrophysical Sciences Department's reputation as a pleasant workplace with a lively and friendly scientific atmosphere which recognizes that technical innovations are an important intellectual contribution to the science produced by major astronomical surveys.
Interested persons should send a curriculum vita including bibliography, if applicable, and provide contact information for three references. The final candidate will be required to complete a background check successfully.
For further inquiries, contact John Swinbank (swinbank at princeton.edu) or Jim Bosch (jbosch at astro.princeton.edu). Apply online at https://jobs.princeton.edu/applicants/jsp/shared/position/Jo....

CBS, Entercom, ESPN, The Washington Post, Sports Illustrated, and over 3,000 others rely on Second Street to create meaningful interactions with their consumers.
We’re a close-knit, vibrant organization located in downtown St. Louis -- close to Wash Ave, the Metro lines, and the Arch. Second Streeters have a passion for software and the success of our customers. We host local meetups whenever possible, including the STL Ember.js meetup. More than anything, we value and trust each other. We set our own goals and and give everyone the opportunity to offer feedback on major projects. We keep it casual and work together to get things done.
Position Summary
This position will be a member of our cross-functional development team which is made up of designers, testers, back-end developers, and front-end developers. Members of the team enjoy a high level of autonomy while also working very collaboratively in-person and using Slack, Trello, and Hangouts. We work together to ship code every day and are constantly looking for ways to improve. Developers at Second Street are fully involved in every part of the process, from planning, to developing, to testing, to launch. We strive to use best practices including version control, automated testing, responsive design, code reviews, and occasional pair programming while keeping an eye toward usability and user experience. This position, in particular, will have a special focus on making sure we’re using best practices in our front-end development, especially with Ember.js. A typical day could consist of anything from spooling up a new ember-cli application and integrating with our existing library of ember-cli addons to helping another member of the team work through a particularly vexing issue.

Hi! We're Nylas and we're looking for help building the next generation email platform. We're building a missing piece of Internet infrastructure and are looking for frontend application engineers and designers and backend systems and infrastructure/operations engineers to join us.
Companies are building their core businesses around our email API right now, and that means we have to be reliable, up all the time, and fast. We have more data for a single user than in most startups' entire database. We're scaling heavily and if you have experience with automated deployments, debugging running systems, release engineering, and on-call schedules, but are still comfortable writing code, this job might be for you. :)
Many people spend their entire days buried in mail clients which haven't significantly changed in years. Yet have you ever met anyone who really loves their email experience? We want to change that. We're building a frontend framework to power the next generation of mail apps. Sound exciting to you? Apply here.
== We're particularly looking for folks who ==
* Take personal pride in their work and value craftsmanship, autonomy and ownership.
* Want the chance to step up and lead a team.
* Put the work before ego. We've got each others' backs, and we want you to be with us on that.
== A bit more about us ==
* Our backend is built on tools like Python, Flask, gevent, nginx, MySQL, AWS, and Debian. We've been careful to keep our architecture componentized.
* Our frontend projects use Coffeescript, React, (Re)Flux, SQL for offline caching, Electron (Atom Shell), and no jQuery.
* Tons of our code is open source, including our main sync engine. Check it out: https://github.com/nylas
* We're 40% women on our team of 13 (12 engineers), including 1 of 2 cofounders. We want to make that number 50%.
* We have an open vacation policy and value personal responsibility and ownership. Benefits include full health, dental, vision, commuter, and lunch at the office every day. Some remote work / work-from-home is OK too.
Apply at https://nylas.com/jobs - you can also ping me directly (jennie at nylas dot com), I'm one of the platform engineers. We're a diverse team and encourage applications from those of all backgrounds.

Hey!
I've read really great things about Curalate's culture, and rumor has it your engineering team is really strong. I'm a full stack developer with 8 years of experience, but have never worked with Scala. That said, I know I could pick it up very quickly. Is that an issue?
reply

Curaladie 4 days ago

That's awesome to hear that you've read/heard about our culture and dev team--we are really proud of both, so I'm glad that they are getting the props they deserve. As far as Scala goes, no, you do not need to know Scala from the get-go. Many of our engineers have learned it at Curalate, but having several years of experience in at least one object-oriented language is crucial. Let me know if you need anything else!

Flexport is a platform for global trade. We make it easier for the next generation of brands to get their products to market. Paul Graham says, "Flexport is one of those rare startups that will not merely satisfy its market, but grow it. There will be more international trade because of Flexport, and international trade is a very big thing for there to be more of." We've raised $6.9M seed from great investors including Google Ventures, Bloomberg BETA, First Round Capital and others. And we've reached product-market fit with over $1M in monthly revenue. We're now looking to build out our engineering team here in San Francisco.
Senior Front-End Engineer
Flexport is looking for talented front-end engineers to join our team here in San Francisco. This is a high impact and high ownership opportunity for self-starters interested in solving real-world problems and streamlining the inefficient industry of global trade. You’ll report to our CTO, Amos Elliston, who previously co-founded Geni, where he helped build and spin out Yammer.
What You’ll Do
* Create tools that make it easier for companies of all sizes to participate in global trade * Help build intuitive, highly efficient and performant interfaces to automate the repetitive parts of logistics
What You’ll Need

Our team of energized and happy brainiacs is made up of diverse interests and personalities. We've got semi-pro athletes, ping-pong enthusiasts, avid surfers, chicken farmers, jugglers, knitters and everything in between. But we share one common focus: making killer products that will improve the really hard and potentially un-fun process of finding the right place to live.
There are so many reasons that working here is great, but we've narrowed it to the top three:
1. There's always something awesome happening. No matter what is being built, we're hard at work figuring out what the next big thing is going to be. Knowing that there's always some innovation on the way keeps this place buzzing. Plus, consistently seeing ridiculous month-on-month user growth doesn't hurt the excitement factor!
2. We're good people. When it comes to hiring, we've adopted a strict "no jerks" rule. Our culture is open and friendly, and not to be trifled with, no matter your level of talent. Whether we are planning projects or grabbing a keg-fresh beer on our roof deck, we genuinely like each other. Who doesn't like that?
3. Start-up fire with big company benefits. Want the fast-moving pace of a start-up with the perks of a company that has been around the block? Us, too. We know that the laundry list of super competitive pay, stock, snacks in the kitchen, and appreciation for a job well done are baseline requirements, so we go way beyond. Investing back into our team's success and future is our goal. Matching 401(k), fully paid medical/dental/vision coverage, multiple flexible spending accounts, and a legit maternity and paternity plan. We've got it all...and then some.

Our full-stack team gets involved with many of of the other teams including but not limited to Product, Sales and Customer Success.

We are all learning and trying to push the boundaries.
We have an incredible bunch of smart people. Some of us did things in the past that caught some public attention. Our CEO sold multiple companies in the past, one to Yahoo. Our head of data science was in one of the teams that found the Higgs boson at CERN using machine learning. I am the co-author of Scala Slick and worked with Martin Odersky for a few years. Join the propellor heads and build something awesome with us :). Perfect employer.

MaidSafe.net [http://maidsafe.net] | Troon, UK (allows remote)
- Rust Open Source Software Engineer [http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/90236/rust-open-source...]
Job Description
Can you imagine a new decentralised Internet, free from corporations selling your personal details and private information for their profit, where users are in control of their data and all communication is secure, private and anonymous? What if this new network was comprised of the spare computing resources of the world’s Internet users and has years of planning and development behind it.
The company implementing the replacement for much of the Internet’s services is called MaidSafe and they plan a public launch of the platform later this year. This new network has generated much interest from the world’s technology press.
http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/23/maidsafe/

This role provides the opportunity to work for a cutting edge open source company with a big future, as well as the freedom to push your skills to the limit.
While an office based developer is preferred, this may be a remote position where for ease of collaboration, the candidate will be required to work between 09:30 and 17:30 UK time (British Summer Time) Monday through Friday.
Skills & Requirements
- Commits have been made to verifiable open source repositories
- Experience in Rust preferred, but not essential
- Experience working within an iterative Agile development process
- A proven track record of submitting quality bug reports to open source issue trackers, preferably with bug fixes. Some links to examples would be great
- A presence on Stack Overflow, where you have asked or answered hard questions and been recognised by others for your answers
- Familiarity with revision control and hosted repositories
In addition to supplying a CV, a list of URLs (code contributions, stack overflow answers, mailing list posts) containing evidence of why you would be a great hire, is essential. It would be great if you could supply a github.com or sourceforge.net, or equivalent account for MaidSafe to review.

Firefly Learning | Developers | London UK | ONSITE
Imagine you could save every teacher in a school one hour a week. Instead of an hour of drudgery, they could be preparing their lessons, teaching or actually having a life outside the classroom. At Firefly, you can help do exactly that.
Firefly is a learning platform used by hundreds of schools worldwide to create, share and learn. We combine easy content creation with deep school integration to make a useful tool for class work, homework, and coursework. We’re self funded and doubling yearly.
As an established company serving many customers and integrating with a variety of other services, we’re continually learning how apply best practices to existing code, whilst still deploying new features and bug fixes for teachers and students every two weeks. We're currently focusing on getting better at separating of concerns and building up an automated testing suite. We’re also improving the speed and reliability of our infrastructure, and trying new technologies to keep current (e.g. Swift and React).
We looking for four main strengths in you:
◦ skill: your colleagues would say you get things done. You work to a high standard, and know about and apply appropriate best practices in your work. You are at home with improving and extending existing code as well as new development.
◦ desire to learn: despite (or perhaps because of) you being good at what you do, you want to get better. You seek out best practices, new ideas, honest feedback, and unknown areas of code, in order to know more and work better.
◦ understanding: our product team is great but not infallible. You’ll be happy to challenge and clarify product decisions with our users’ best interests at heart. Similarly, our QA team is meticulous but not your babysitter. You’ll be handing something polished to QA, not throwing the first thing that compiles over the wall. Overall, everyone at Firefly shares responsibility for the product making sense and being of high quality.
◦ clear communication: We have a lightweight process, so most days, other than a morning standup meeting to share what’s going on and what’s planned, you’ll be responsible for your time. This also means that, when there are issues, you need to inform the right people, explain what’s going wrong, and help get things resolved and moving forward again.
Speaking of process, we have a design team who handle HTML and CSS, a product and UX team who produce clear specifications, a QA team to help us build things well, and a two-week sprint cycle for getting things done. Other than that, we’re pretty small-a agile and are happy to try things out to see what helps.
In terms of experience, we need you to be comfortable with iOS or a web platform. Our server-side code is written in C# and our web front end has some Javascript, so you’ll need to know these or be able to pick them up. We work as generalists, so experience of any of the following would be a positive: Android, Windows Phone, shell scripting, infrastructure automation, databases, particularly SQL Server, building API integrations.
We offer competitive salaries dependent on experience, a generous bonus scheme, flexible training budget, brown bag talks and a Kaizen day for self-improvement and experimentation every fortnight.
So, if you’ve got an interest in education and a desire to learn your craft alongside others making the same journey, we want to hear from you. Drop me an e-mail (robin at fireflylearning.com) or apply on our website – http://fireflylearning.com/join-our-team/jobs/developer

Actual Experience PLC, Provider of Digital Quality analytics services | Android Developer | Bath, UK | ONSITE (with home-working) | FULLTIME
https://www.actual-experience.com/
We offer digital quality analysis services for businesses and consumers. Our Digital Supply Chain Director service enables continuous, automatic, and real-time Voice of the Customer analysis, identifying any sources of service misbehaviour and directing attention where improvement in experience for staff and customers will be most meaningful. Our service is being incorporated into digital product architectures and processes for some of the world’s largest, most sophisticated digital enterprises.
To give a concrete example: 95% of a web-page may load in a fraction of a second, but the quality of the user-experience is adversely affected by the last image (or javascript, or whatever) taking 3 seconds to arrive from the CDN. Our software captures this kind of measurement and helps identify the cause. It's not limited to web-pages; we have measurement profiles for email, database, VoIP, cloud services etc. We can also help identify where the service is too good, where the additional speed is essentially wasted and, perhaps, the investment would be better made in other areas of an infrastructure.
You can see the technology in action with our consumer version, BbFix. (https://www.bbfix.org/) This allows you to see how good your broadband really is. And where any problems lie from home router to ISP to the Skype or iPlayer endpoints.
We're looking for an Android developer to create apps, in the short-term, to:
- Report the results of the analysis in a simple, engaging way that CxOs can understand
- Measure the Digital Quality to and from from mobile devices and services in a similar way to our current wired Digital Users. With our Tier-1 clients you could have your app deployed to hundreds of thousands of devices.
Beyond that we have plans for tablets and a mobile version of BbFix.
The job-spec is here: https://www.actual-experience.com/site/assets/files/1036/ae_...
We have a mixed technology base: Erlang, Python and the usual Web-stack. The iOS app is Swift-based. Our APIs are JSON and we use Git. You might not know all of them but you'll be interested in finding out more, given the chance. Finally, the working environment is very relaxed with most people flexibly working from home a couple of days a week. Get in touch via the website with a CV or directly: robin@actual-experience.com with any questions.

Codurance is hiring Software Craftsman ONSITE in London, UK.
You consider yourself a software crafter. You care about and are proud of the code you write. You care about doing meaningful work and providing value to your clients or employer via well-crafted code. For you, writing code is not just a job but also a passion.
Test-Driven Development is second nature to you and that's how you write code. You don't use "lack of time" as an excuse to do a mediocre job, and fully understand the long-term costs and benefits of hacking a project together. You prefer to work in small increments, trying things out and iterating rapidly, tightening the feedback loop as much as possible.
You are a team player. You understand that software lives on long after it is first delivered, and that many different people will contribute to it over its lifetime. You enjoy working with other people, including other coders but also designers, business analysts, testers and anyone else working on the same project. You enjoy frequent collaboration, including pair-programming.
As a passionate developer, you spend a considerable amount of time outside working hours investing in your craft, learning new technologies and practicing different techniques and approaches. You create for creation's sake, building pet projects or contributing to open-source development. You don't do this because a client or employer asks you to; you do it because you want to.
As part of the learning process, you consider it important to share what you know with others. This might take the form of a blog, some code on GitHub, attendance at community events or something totally different. You also consider it your responsibility to help your fellow colleagues; perhaps this manifests itself as formal knowledge-sharing sessions in the workplace, but just as likely, it's simply coaching as and when it's necessary.
You understand that languages and frameworks are just tools. You choose the best tools for the job without being religious about it. The majority of books and articles you read are the ones that makes you a better developer and not a specialist in a specific framework. At the same time, you are extremely proficient with at least one or two programming languages and the tools around them, including testing frameworks, wiring and dependency injection mechanisms, user interface libraries and development environments.
You understand and embrace Agile processes, and are able to help other people to understand and adopt them. You are able to work closely with clients and product owners and help them to refine requirements and plan the work to be done.
You are proud to be a developer and want to remain a developer. You believe in emergent and collaborative architecture and design; you use your knowledge of SOLID principles, the Four Elements of Simple Design, and Domain-Driven Design to design applications that reflect the business domain.
If you believe you can meet the bar set, we are definitely interested in hearing from you.

[Front Row Education (San Francisco, CA) www.frontrowed.com]
Foundational Systems Engineer with DevOps focus to join fast-growing education startup that changes how over a million young students learn math.
Our mission is important to us, and we want it to be important to you as well: over a million K-8 students learn math using Front Row every month. Our early results show students improve twice as much while using Front Row than their peers who aren’t using the program.
You’ll be one of the first engineers on the team, which means you’ll have an immense impact on our company, product, and culture; you’ll have a ton of autonomy and responsibility; you’ll have equity to match the weight of this role. If you're looking for an opportunity to both grow and do meaningful work, surrounded and supported by like-minded professionals, this is THE place for you.
Front Row is one of the very few organizations in the world that use Haskell in production for most of their systems and is an active member of the Haskell community, including the Commercial Haskell Special Interest Group.
- Be able to work quickly and without handholding or supervision. You will have great autonomy. We're a small team and everybody easily pulls twice their weight
- You're morbidly well-organized, love documenting and obsess over continuously improving existing processes
- Relentlessly automate ALL the things: this is not a sysadmin position, this is developer position that removes the need for most system administration
- You're not religious about any technologies, tools or approaches: the landscape of devops changes every day, new tools emerge, new techniques become trendy. A great devops engineer stays up to date with the emergent technologies, but is committed to using the right tool for the job, whether that's an allen wrench or an immutable cluster
- You must care about being great at what you do. Front Row engineers are craftsmen who take pride in their work
- Must thrive on both technical breadth and depth. As a Front Row Systems Engineer, you will be taking care of setting up, maintaining and scaling a wide variety critical supporting infrastructure that makes running our applications possible and pleasant
- Experience working with cloud APIs, configuration management, deployment
- Experience running, maintaining and scaling RDBMS - we're heavy Postgres users and deal with a lot of critical data
- You love sharing your knowledge and teaching others about systems engineering and devops. Front Row has a very active culture of sharing of knowledge and best practices. As our first Systems Engineer, you will be setting much of the technical culture for the organization.

Position: CTO
Location:	NY Metro (ideal), but will look at Remote (Continental 48 States)
Company:	Wine Kloud – www.winekloud.com
_____
COMPANY OVERVIEW:
Wine Kloud is a content curator of daily wine deals from over 1,000 retailers nationwide. WK leverages the hottest trends (daily deals) in popular culture and marries them with wine. Think Kayak for travel meets wine. And the timing is perfect. Why? Wine Kloud is part of an industry segment that tends to be behind the tech curve as compared to its target audience – wine drinkers! We are not only prepared to change the way an industry operates, but set to change the way millions of consumers buy wine. That is powerful and the CTO will be an integral part that makes it all happen.
WK has not launched yet, but will be live in a couple of weeks. The initial buildout was outsourced to a development firm. We have secured funding and will be happy to disclose all of that information to serious and interested candidates.
_____
POSITION DESCRIPTION/REQUIREMENTS:
We are in search of a team member, not a rogue. We are collaborators, not dictators. Sounds cliché, but very true. We want to foster an environment in which we all have valuable input and can work positively and effectively toward the common goals of the company. To be clear, the individual we hire will have full direction over the tech strategy, but that strategy will be designed and created as a result of the management goals, which this person will help establish.
We need someone who can innovate, plan, build, implement, and drive all of the company’s tech initiatives, including coding. While we have plans to build out a team underneath this person in the very near future, in the beginning, they will have to roll up their sleeves and code. This is not a country club position in which they delegate. This is a startup. This individual will also be responsible for maintaining all aspects of our software, from debugging to taking preventative measures to ensure uptime.
This person’s actions will directly shape the company. Their stamp will be all over Wine Kloud. This is a big role and requires someone with the experience and acumen to fill it. We need someone who is passionate about building and problem solving. Someone who can contribute to and incorporate the company vision. Someone entrepreneurial in nature with the ability to lead and, ideally, successful startup experience. And possibly most important, someone who is committed to the success of the organization. We are not looking for a year-long commitment from someone. We need someone onboard who will see out the company’s success.
_____
TECH PROFILE:
Here’s the tech stack that our developers are working with. The ideal hire will know these well:
- Python
- Django
- MySQL
- Redis
- Celery
- Stream Framework
- Python Social Auth
- Apache
- 3rd Party Services like Payment Gateways
